- 👋 Hi, I’m @kaitlynkliewer
- 👀 I’m an engineer with a PhD in Structural Engineering focusing on structural health monitoring (SHM). Don't know what SHM is? SHM is the process of deploying various sensors and data processing methods to determine the health or well-being of a structure such as a bridge or tall building. 
- 🌱 I enjoy learning new skills and I'm currently learning webdevelopment and python.
- 💞️ I’m always happy to collaborate, especially on anything that combines programming and structural engineering or structural health monitoring!
